## Demos & APIs & Datasets
* **Effidit** (Efficient and Intelligent Editing): A writing assistant with diversified and practical functions, including Text Completion, Error Correction, Text Polishing, K2S (Keyword-based sentence recommendation and generation), Cloud IME and etc. Specifically, text completion involves phrase completion, retrieval-based sentence completion and AI generation-based sentence continuation. Text polishing contains phrase-level polishing, sentence-level paraphrase and expansion.

* **TexSmart**: A core NLP system that supports lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis of text in Chinese and English. In addition to the functions supported by a typical core NLP tool (such as word segmentation, POS tagging, and NER), TexSmart also provides some unique features: fine-grained NER, semantic expansion, and rich semantic represention of (certain types of) entities.
